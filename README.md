# Big-Basket-Project

In this Project, I analyzed a dataset of over 27,000 products from Big Basket to uncover insights on product pricing, ratings, categories, and sales trends. The analysis included:
Identifying the top and least sold products (e.g., Turmeric Powder was the most sold).
Detecting missing values and cleaning the dataset.
Visualizing the distribution of discounts, ratings, and price ranges.
Using boxplots to find and treat outliers in numeric data.
Creating new columns like discount amount to enhance insights.

Tools used: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Outcome: A cleaned, visualized dataset saved for future modeling or reporting.
